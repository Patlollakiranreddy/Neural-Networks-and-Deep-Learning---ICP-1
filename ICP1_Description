1.Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to 
fullname function that should return the (full name). 
 
Description: This program prompts the user to input their first and last names. It defines two 
functions: full name combines the first and last names into a full name, and string_alternative returns 
every other character of the full name using string slicing. The program displays both the full name 
and the alternative string with every other character removed. The logic is executed within the main 
function, which handles user input and calls the other functions to display the results. 

2. Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the 
output. o Finally store the output in output.txt file.

Description: This Python program processes a text file by reading each line, counting the frequency 
of each word using the Counter class from the collectionâ€™s module, and then writing both the original 
line and the word frequencies to a new output file. It first opens the input file, reads the lines, and 
splits each line into words. The Counter is used to tally the occurrences of each word in the line. Then, 
the program writes the original line to the output file, followed by the word counts for that line, 
formatted as "word: count". Finally, the output file contains the original text along with word 
frequencies for each line. The program is designed to handle multiple lines in the input file and 
produce a corresponding word count summary for each.

3. Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) of customers into a list and convert these heights    to 
centimetres in a separate list using: 1) Nested Interactive loop. 2) List comprehensions.

Description: This Python program provides two methods to convert customer heights from inches to 
centimetres. The first method, Nested Interactive Loop, allows the user to input the number of 
customers and their corresponding heights in inches. It then converts these heights to centimetres 
and displays the results. The second method, List Comprehension, uses a predefined list of heights in 
inches and applies a more concise approach to convert the heights to centimetres using list 
comprehension. In both methods, the inches_to_cm function is used to perform the conversion by 
multiplying the given height in inches by the conversion factor (2.54). The program then prints the 
converted heights in centimetres for each method.
